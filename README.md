# Stargazer

## About The Project
NASA's Astronomy Pictures of The Day (APOD) are some of the intriguing and beautiful images out there. Stargazer utilizes the NASA APOD api to view high resolution images of this week in space. 

Stargazer an application which fetches the previous week's NASA APODS and allows users to view those images, their information and favorite those images. The user is greeting with a landing page which then transitions to the main navigation page. The user is greeted with the current NASA APOD once landing on the main navigation page. From there the user can navigate through the previous weeks' phots, favoriting images on their way through. Users can visit a favorites page to view all of their favorite images along with url's of each image.

Stargazer is a React application built myself in 6 days.
